# 📄 Translation Company Page Management Program

---

## 🧠 Project Justification

This project was a collaborative effort using **Java with NetBeans**, where I contributed **50%** of the work, specifically focusing on the **Main**, and **Cliente** classes. My teammate **Samuel** was responsible for the **Hojas** class. The project aimed to address the need for more efficient document management in a translation company by implementing a system that uses **Stacks**, **Queues**, and **Lists** to organize and control the workflow of translation documents, ensuring that each page goes through a well-defined process of translation, quality control, and client management.

## 🎯 Objective

The primary goal was to develop a system that streamlines the management of large volumes of translation documents, utilizing stacks, queues, and lists for storage and order management. This would ensure that each document is handled in an orderly, efficient manner, with a clear history of each page’s use and a well-structured client request process.

## 🕵️ Field Study

The project is designed to optimize document flow in a translation company. By implementing structures like **Stacks** for managing available pages, **Queues** for handling customer requests, and **Lists** for tracking used pages, this system aims to resolve issues related to delays, confusion, and unorganized workflows that are common in many translation companies.

## 🛠 Project Overview

The project was developed in **Java** using **NetBeans** as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The system is built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, making it modular and easy to maintain. The program is designed to handle translation page inventory, customer requests, and historical records efficiently, ensuring that documents are processed in the correct order.

## 🔑 Key Features

- 📋 **Inventory Management:** Manages a stack of translation pages, moving used pages to a list for tracking.
- 🧑‍💼 **Customer Management:** Uses a queue to handle customer requests in the order they arrive.
- 🧾 **Historical Records:** Tracks used pages and served clients, allowing easy retrieval of past transactions.
- 🔄 **Document Workflow:** Ensures that documents are processed in the correct order, preventing delays and confusion.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

Although this was a team project, I was responsible for developing approximately **50%** of the code, focusing on the core logic, class design, product management, and purchase simulation., **Main**, and **Cliente** classes. **Samuel** contributed the remaining **50%**, working primarily on the **Hojas** class.
